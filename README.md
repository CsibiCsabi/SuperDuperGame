# SuperDuperGame

This is my fifrst Godot project! I've already made some games in Unity and participated in Juice. I watched a simple tutorial video to start off, and then dived deeper into Godot mechanics, like bounciness, collisions, moving.

# How to play
You should click on the demo link and start playing. The object of the game is to reach the finish line using the pipes to bounce forward.
The pipes don't kill you
